[In this video][1] (10 sec) you can see that the nested attribute is only updated if it's parent model is updated.

Using rails 3.0.0.beta and [full project is on github][2].

Summary of models and form:

    class Project < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_many :tasks
      accepts_nested_attributes_for :tasks
    end
    
    class Task < ActiveRecord::Base
      belongs_to :project
      has_many :assignments
      accepts_nested_attributes_for :assignments
    end
    
    class Assignment < ActiveRecord::Base
      belongs_to :task
    end


    form_for(@project) do |f|
    
      Project: f.text_field :name
      
      f.fields_for :tasks do |task_form|
        Task: task_form.text_field :name
        
        task_form.fields_for :assignments do |assignment_form|
          Assignment: assignment_form.text_field :name
        end
      end
